		<h1>A$AP Rocky - Praise The Lord (Da Shine) (Official Video) ft. Skepta</h1>
		<p>
			A$AP Rocky and Skepta pay tribute to their hometowns in the grunge-y new video for their collab "Praise the Lord (Da Shine)"--and, turns out, international living isn't so different after all.

			The split-screen clip features the two rappers' lives in New York City and in London, where they go about similar day-to-day activities like partying with their friends and riding bikes around town.
